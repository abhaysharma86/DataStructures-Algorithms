Method Reference:
---------------------

Method reference is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. There are four types of method references that are as follows:


Static Method Reference
Instance Method Reference of a particular object
Instance Method Reference of an arbitrary object of a particular type
Constructor Reference.

Example:

numList.stream().filter(n -> n > 5).sorted().forEach(System.out::println);
