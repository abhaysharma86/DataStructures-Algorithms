BiConsumer Interface:
-------------------------

The BiConsumer Interface is a part of the java.util.function package which has been introduced since Java 8, to implement functional programming in Java.
It represents a function that takes in two arguments and produces a result. However, these kinds of functions doesn’t return any value.

Points:
1. Tack two arguments (T , U)
2. Doesn't return any value

This functional interface takes in two generics, namely:-

T: denotes the type of the first input argument to the operation
U: denotes the type of the second input argument to the operation



Functions in BiConsumer Interface:
-----------------------------------

The BiConsumer interface consists of the following two functions:

1. accept()

This method accepts two values and performs the operation on the given arguments

Syntax:
-------

void accept(T t, U u)


Parameters: This method takes in two parameters:

t– the first input argument
u– the second input argument
Returns: This method does not return any value.
